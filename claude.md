# LeastTrust Website Improvement Plan
## Strategic Repositioning: Insider Threat & Proprietary Data Protection

---

## Executive Summary

**Current Problem**: Website positioning is too broad, covering general cybersecurity compliance (SOC2, cyber insurance) alongside insider threat services, creating confusion about core value proposition.

**Strategic Direction**: Refocus website on **insider threat maturity and proprietary data protection** - specifically the 90% of data that isn't regulated but drives business value.

**Core Business**:
- Insider threat maturity (CMMI) assessments
- Proprietary data protection (trade secrets, IP, competitive intelligence)
- IP strategy and enforcement
- Third-party risk and due diligence
- Installing controls to train, deter, detect, and enforce IP rights
- Protecting "crown jewels"

**Target Personas**:
1. **General Counsels**: IP protection, legal defensibility, trade secret enforcement
2. **CISOs**: Insider risk programs, detection capabilities, maturity progression
3. **Compliance Leaders**: Program maturity, policy frameworks, third-party risk
4. **VCs & Investors**: Portfolio protection, due diligence, investment risk reduction, valuation enhancement

---

## Current State Analysis

### Website Structure (10 Pages)

#### Core Pages (Keep & Enhance):
1. **Home** (`/`) - Needs strategic refocus
2. **Insider Threat** (`/insider-threat`) - Make this PRIMARY service
3. **Data Protection** (`/data-protection`) - Refocus on proprietary data
4. **Insider Platform** (`/insider-platform`) - Strengthen as main product
5. **Corporate Training** (`/group-training`) - Refocus on IP awareness
6. **About** (`/about`) - Keep, add credentials
7. **Previous Engagements** (`/previous-engagements`) - Refocus case studies

#### Pages to Remove/Demote (Compliance-Heavy):
8. **SOC2 & Cyber Insurance** (`/soc2-cyber-insurance`) - **REMOVE** or demote
9. **Cyber Insurance Readiness** (`/cyber-insurance-readiness`) - **REMOVE** or demote
10. **Employee Use Cases** (`/employee-use-cases`) - **CONSOLIDATE** with Previous Engagements

**Result**: Streamline to **7 focused pages** on insider threat and proprietary data

## Strategic Messaging Framework

### Core Value Propositions

#### The Big Idea
**"Protect the 90% of Your Data That Drives Your Business"**

Most security focuses on regulated data (PII, PHI, PCI). But your competitive advantage comes from:
- Trade secrets and proprietary methodologies
- Product roadmaps and strategic plans
- Customer lists and pricing strategies
- Research and intellectual property
- Competitive intelligence and market insights

This unregulated proprietary data is what insiders target - and what drives business value.

#### The Four Pillars (Train, Deter, Detect, Enforce)

**TRAIN**: Educate employees on IP protection and acceptable use
- IP awareness training
- Data classification and handling
- Insider threat indicators
- Reporting suspicious behavior

**DETER**: Implement controls that discourage malicious behavior
- Access controls and monitoring
- Clear policies and consequences
- Separation of duties
- NDA enforcement

**DETECT**: Identify insider threats early
- Behavioral analytics
- Anomaly detection
- Early warning indicators
- Continuous monitoring

**ENFORCE**: Respond effectively when threats materialize
- Incident response procedures
- Legal defensibility documentation
- Forensic readiness
- IP rights enforcement

#### CMMI Maturity Focus

Position the insider threat maturity assessment (CMMI-based) as the starting point:
- Level 1: Ad-hoc (no formal program)
- Level 2: Managed (basic policies exist)
- Level 3: Defined (comprehensive program in place)
- Level 4: Quantitatively Managed (metrics-driven)
- Level 5: Optimizing (continuous improvement)

Help organizations progress from Level 1-2 to Level 3-4.

```
"Protect the 90% That Matters Most"

HIPAA, PCI, GDPR - regulations cover ~10% of your data.
But your competitive advantage comes from the other 90%:
Trade secrets. IP. Strategic plans. Customer intelligence.
That's what insiders target. That's what we protect.
```

- **Proprietary data** (instead of "sensitive data")
- **Insider threat maturity**
- **Trade secrets** and **IP protection**
- **Crown jewels**
- **CMMI** (Capability Maturity Model Integration)
- **Four pillars**: Train, Deter, Detect, Enforce
- **Legal defensibility**
- **Reasonable measures** (legal standard for trade secret protection)
- **Early warning indicators**
- **Third-party risk**
- **Due diligence**
- **The 90% of data that isn't regulated**

- ~~Data breach~~ (too generic - be specific: "insider exfiltration," "IP theft")
- ~~General security~~ or ~~comprehensive protection~~ (too vague)
- ~~PII, PHI, PCI~~ (we focus on unregulated proprietary data)

### Tone & Voice:
- **Authoritative** on insider threat and IP protection
- **Practical** not theoretical
- **Business-focused** not technical jargon
- **Specific** not generic
- **Outcome-oriented** (maturity progression, threats prevented, legal defensibility)

## Competitive Differentiation

### What to Emphasize vs. Competitors:

**LeastTrust Differentiators**:
1. **CMMI-based maturity model** (structured progression, not just tools)
2. **Proprietary data focus** (not regulated data)
3. **Four-pillar approach** (Train, Deter, Detect, Enforce - not just technology)
4. **Legal defensibility** (support for IP litigation, "reasonable measures")
5. **Business-focused** (tailored to operations, not checkbox compliance)
6. **Third-party risk** (contractors, vendors, M&A, not just employees)

**What Competitors Do** (position against this):
- Focus on insider threat technology/tools only (we do programs + platform)
- Focus on regulated data protection (we focus on proprietary data)
- One-size-fits-all solutions (we tailor to maturity level and business needs)
- Compliance-driven (we're business-value-driven)
- Employee monitoring only (we do full lifecycle: train, deter, detect, enforce)

### Messaging Against Competitors:

**If Competitor = DLP/CASB Vendor**:
"Technology alone isn't enough. You need a mature program - policies, training, procedures, and enforcement - not just monitoring tools. Our platform enables the full program, not just detection."

**If Competitor = General Security Consultant**:
"We specialize exclusively in insider threat maturity and proprietary data protection. It's not an add-on service - it's all we do."

**If Competitor = Compliance Consultant (SOC2, ISO, etc.)**:
"We don't do checkbox compliance. We protect the proprietary data that drives your business - trade secrets, IP, competitive intelligence. The 90% that regulations don't cover."

**If Competitor = User Behavior Analytics (UBA/UEBA) Vendor**:
"Behavioral analytics are one piece. But you also need policies, training, legal defensibility, incident response, and enforcement. We build the complete program, with maturity progression."
